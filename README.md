# Sentinel-Lab
Practicing using Microsoft Azure for Cybersecurity purposes

SIEM stands for security information and event management and provides organizations with next-generation detection, analytics and response. SIEM software combines security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) to provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. SIEM software matches events against rules and analytics engines and indexes them for sub-second search to detect and analyze advanced threats using globally gathered intelligence. This gives security teams both insight into and a track record of the activities within their IT environment by providing data analysis, event correlation, aggregation, reporting and log management.


# Description
The Powershell script in this repository is responsible for parsing out Windows Event Log information for failed RDP attacks and using a third party API to collect geographic information about the attackers location.

The script is used in this demo where I setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. We will observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. I will use a custom PowerShell script to look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on an Azure Sentinel Map!

# Languages Used
PowerShell: Extract RDP failed logon logs from Windows Event Viewer

# Utilities Used
ipgeolocation.io: IP Address to Geolocation API

# Attacks from China coming in; Custom logs being output with geodata

Financial institutions continue to be some of the most highly targeted organizations for cybercrime. According to Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42, “financial services firms are 300 times more likely than other companies to be targeted by cyber attacks,” with common threat vectors including phishing, insider threats, and malware. SIEM platforms help organizations manage this elevated risk by collecting and correlating logs and event data to detect threats, giving security teams the visibility needed to analyze attacks and test the effectiveness of their defenses. Above is my Failed RDP World Map that monitors threats from countries all over the world, tracking unauthorized remote access attempts from around the world to help identify and respond to high-risk activity in real time.
