SIEM stands for security information and event management and provides organizations with next-generation detection, analytics and response. SIEM software combines security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) to provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. SIEM software matches events against rules and analytics engines and indexes them for sub-second search to detect and analyze advanced threats using globally gathered intelligence. This gives security teams both insight into and a track record of the activities within their IT environment by providing data analysis, event correlation, aggregation, reporting and log management.

Financial cyber-attacks are 300x more likely than security breaches in other industries, from the likes of phishing, insider threats and malware attack vectors. SIEM software works by collecting log and event data to get details about attacks and to test their threat preventions. Above is my Failed RDP World Map that monitors threats from countries all over the world.
